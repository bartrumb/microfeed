  - Implemented proper CSS bundling
  - Fixed filesystem interaction issues
  - Successfully built project
- Added security and performance improvements:
  - Implemented proper cache control
  - Added security headers
  - Optimized asset bundling
  - Fixed CSS compatibility issues
- Standardized asset paths:
  - Updated Vite output configuration
  - Fixed HtmlHeader component path resolution
  - Implemented consistent path structure
  - Removed environment-specific logic
- Fixed development environment:

  - Added PowerShell-based cleanup

## Current State
- ✅ Build system improvements completed:
  - PowerShell-based cleanup solution working
  - CSS bundling configured and working
  - Asset paths structured correctly
  - Manifest generation enabled
- ✅ Asset loading issues resolved:
  - Bundled assets with proper hashing
  - CSS code splitting implemented
  - Admin styles properly bundled
- ✅ Filesystem compatibility fixes in place:
  - WSL/Windows interaction issues documented
  - Cleanup operations using PowerShell
  - Build process working reliably
- ✅ Asset path standardization completed:
  - Updated Vite configuration
  - Fixed HtmlHeader component
  - Assets loading correctly in development
  - Proper directory structure in place

## Implementation Notes
- Using PowerShell for reliable file operations
- CSS bundling now uses explicit file paths
- Asset output structure reorganized:
  - JS files in /assets/client/
  - Chunks in /assets/client/chunks/
  - CSS files in /assets/
- Build manifest disabled in development
- CSS modules configured with scoped names
- Cache-Control headers set for static assets
- Security headers implemented in middleware
- HTML rendering now properly handles DOCTYPE and formatting
- Asset paths standardized between dev and prod
- Development environment now matches production paths

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement automated accessibility testing?
2. Do we need to add more comprehensive error boundaries?
3. Should we extend accessibility enhancements to other form components?
4. Should we add additional asset optimization techniques?
5. Should we implement a more robust file cleanup strategy for WSL/Windows interactions?
6. Should we add monitoring for build process failures?
7. Should we implement automated manifest validation?
8. Do we need additional fallback strategies for asset loading?

## Next Actions
1. Deploy to preview environment to test changes
2. Verify asset loading in production-like environment
3. Test CSS bundling and code splitting
4. Validate cache control headers
5. Check manifest usage for asset versioning
6. Monitor build performance metrics
7. Document new build configuration
8. Create filesystem operation guidelines
