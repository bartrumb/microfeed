## Current Focus: Resolving Asset Loading and Code Editor Issues

We are addressing several issues with asset loading and the code editor functionality:

### Fixed Issues

1. **Code Editor Template Loading**
   - ✅ Fixed missing theme template data in code editor
   - ✅ Updated route handler to pass correct template data
   - ✅ Ensured proper data structure for template rendering
   - ✅ Fixed slugify function loading in utils chunk

2. **Asset Loading**
   - ✅ Fixed CSS naming inconsistency
   - ✅ Added constants chunk configuration
   - ✅ Fixed path duplication in entry point file names
   - ✅ Enabled public directory serving for OpenAPI files

### Remaining Issues

1. **404 Errors**
   - [ ] ReactToastify.css.map not found (404 error)
   - [ ] Constants.js.map not found (404 error)
   - [ ] Fallback paths being used for some assets

2. **Asset Loading Improvements**
   - [ ] Monitor asset loading performance
   - [ ] Implement retry logic for failed loads
   - [ ] Add error reporting for asset failures

### Action Items

1. **Fix ReactToastify Issues**
   - ✅ Disable source maps for CSS files in production
   - ✅ Added CSS devSourcemap configuration in vite.config.js

2. **Fix Constants.js Issues**
   - ✅ Fix case sensitivity mismatch between chunk definition and output
   - ✅ Updated chunk naming from 'constants' to 'Constants' for consistency
   - ✅ Ensured proper casing in chunk definition

3. **Source Map Handling**
   - ✅ Disabled source maps for production builds
   - ✅ Configured sourcemap: mode === 'development' ? true : false
   - ✅ Updated deployment process to verify source map files

4. **Root Causes Identified**
   - Source maps enabled in vite.config.js but not properly handled in deployment
   - Case sensitivity mismatch between chunk definition and output files
   - CSS extraction configuration not properly handling source maps
   - Deployment process not verifying source map files

### Dependencies
- Vite configuration
- React components
- Build pipeline
- Cloudflare Pages deployment

### Open Questions
- Should we implement retry logic for failed asset loads?
- Do we need additional monitoring for error states?
- Should we implement automated tests for these scenarios?
