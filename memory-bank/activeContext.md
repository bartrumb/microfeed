## Current Focus: Implementing Type Checking in Microfeed

We are implementing a comprehensive type checking system for the Microfeed application to prevent runtime errors and improve code quality.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Core Type Definitions**
   - ✅ Created common-src/types/FeedContent.ts
   - ✅ Defined interfaces for main data structures (FeedContent, Item, Channel, Settings)
   - ✅ Added type guards for safer data access
   - ✅ Implemented utility types for common patterns

2. **Critical Component Migration**
   - ✅ Converted ErrorBoundary component to TypeScript
   - ✅ Added proper error and props typing to ErrorBoundary
   - ✅ Converted withManifest HOC to TypeScript with generic types
   - ✅ Converted EdgeAdminItemsApp to TypeScript
   - ✅ Added proper null checks in client-side scripts

3. **Type System Improvements**
   - ✅ Added proper interface for manifest data
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling with TypeScript
   - ✅ Added type safety to HOC implementations
   - ✅ Implemented proper generic constraints

### Current Status
We've successfully implemented the initial phase of type checking, focusing on core data structures and critical components. The type system is now providing better error detection and IDE support.

### Next Steps

1. **Continue Component Migration**
   - Convert AdminWholeHtml component to TypeScript
   - Convert remaining Edge components
   - Add type annotations to server-side handlers

2. **Utility Functions Migration**
   - Convert StringUtils.js to TypeScript
   - Convert TimeUtils.js to TypeScript
   - Convert ManifestUtils.js to TypeScript
   - Add type guards for safer data access

3. **Testing and Verification**
   - Add tests for type guards
   - Verify type checking catches potential errors
   - Monitor error logs to ensure fixes are working
   - Test edge cases with optional properties

4. **Documentation**
   - Update JSDoc comments for better IDE integration
   - Document type guard usage
   - Add examples for common patterns
   - Create migration guide for remaining components

### Dependencies
- React components
- TypeScript configuration
- Error handling system
- Build pipeline

### Open Questions
- Should we implement retry logic for failed asset loads?
- Do we need additional monitoring for error states?
- Should we implement automated tests for these scenarios?
- What is the priority order for converting remaining components?
