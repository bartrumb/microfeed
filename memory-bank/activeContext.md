1. Fixed D1 configuration for preview environment:
   - Added --env flag to wrangler D1 commands in utils.js
   - Moved preview environment D1 configuration to default configuration
   - Removed redundant preview environment section
   - Updated database IDs and names

Rationale: The issue was that wrangler wasn't properly detecting the preview environment. By moving the preview configuration to the default configuration and explicitly passing the --env flag, we ensure proper environment detection during wrangler commands.
