# Active Context

## Current Focus
Vite and Cloudflare Pages Integration - Asset Path Standardization

## Recent Changes

  - Fixed asset path resolution in ViteUtils
  - Updated HTML components to handle rendering properly
  - Simplified manifest handling
- Fixed asset loading and Cloudflare configuration issues:
  - Updated Vite build configuration
  - Implemented proper CSS bundling
  - Fixed filesystem interaction issues
  - Successfully built project
- Added security and performance improvements:
  - Implemented proper cache control
  - Added security headers
  - Optimized asset bundling
  - Fixed CSS compatibility issues
- Standardized asset paths:
  - Updated Vite output configuration
  - Fixed HtmlHeader component path resolution
  - Implemented consistent path structure
  - Removed environment-specific logic

## Current State
- ✅ Build system improvements completed:
  - PowerShell-based cleanup solution working
  - CSS bundling configured and working
  - Asset paths structured correctly
  - Manifest generation enabled
- ✅ Asset loading issues resolved:
  - Bundled assets with proper hashing
  - CSS code splitting implemented
  - Admin styles properly bundled
- ✅ Filesystem compatibility fixes in place:
  - WSL/Windows interaction issues documented
  - Cleanup operations using PowerShell
  - Build process working reliably
- ✅ Asset path standardization completed:
  - Updated Vite configuration
  - Fixed HtmlHeader component
  - Assets loading correctly in development
  - Proper directory structure in place

## Implementation Plan
1. **Asset Structure Migration**
   - Move from `/assets/client/` to `/_app/immutable/`
   - Update all path references
   - Ensure proper hashing for cache busting

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Configure port 3001 to avoid Wrangler conflicts
   - Enable strictPort for fail-fast behavior
   - Set up proper host configuration
   - Test hot module replacement

3. **Path Resolution Standardization**
   - Unify development and production paths
   - Update ViteUtils.js path handling
   - Fix HtmlHeader component paths
   - Relocate modulepreload polyfill

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Verify local development (`pnpm dev`)
   - Test preview deployment
   - Validate production build
   - Check asset loading and caching

## Implementation Notes
- Using PowerShell for reliable file operations
- CSS bundling now uses explicit file paths
- Development server configured:
  - Port 3001 to avoid Wrangler conflicts
  - strictPort enabled for fail-fast behavior
  - Host configuration for proper networking
- Asset output structure being reorganized:
  - JS entries in /_app/immutable/entry-[name].[hash].js
  - Chunks in /_app/immutable/chunks/[name].[hash].js
  - CSS files in /_app/immutable/assets/[name].[hash].css
  - Other assets in /_app/immutable/assets/[name].[hash].[ext]
- Build manifest disabled in development
- CSS modules configured with scoped names
- Cache-Control headers set for static assets
- Security headers implemented in middleware
- HTML rendering now properly handles DOCTYPE and formatting
- Asset paths standardized between dev and prod with consistent structure
- Development environment now matches production paths

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement automated accessibility testing?
2. Do we need to add more comprehensive error boundaries?
3. Should we extend accessibility enhancements to other form components?
4. Should we add additional asset optimization techniques?
5. Should we implement a more robust file cleanup strategy for WSL/Windows interactions?
6. Should we add monitoring for build process failures?
7. Should we implement automated manifest validation?
8. Do we need additional fallback strategies for asset loading?

## Next Actions
1. Configure development server port and settings
2. Update Vite configuration with new output structure
3. Implement enhanced asset path resolution
4. Test local development build
5. Deploy to preview environment
6. Verify asset loading in production-like environment
7. Test CSS bundling and code splitting
8. Validate cache control headers
9. Check manifest usage for asset versioning
10. Monitor build performance metrics
11. Document new build configuration
12. Create filesystem operation guidelines
