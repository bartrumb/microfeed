# Active Context

## Current Focus
WSL development environment configuration and Vite asset handling

## Recent Changes
- Updated wrangler.toml with environment-specific database configurations
- Enhanced DatabaseInitializer.js with better validation and logging
- Fixed ESLint issues in DatabaseInitializer.js
- Documented comprehensive WSL troubleshooting steps
- Simplified Vite asset path handling for WSL compatibility

## Current State
- Database configurations are now properly separated by environment
- Initialization process includes validation checks
- Logging system is environment-aware
- Code quality issues have been addressed
- WSL development environment fully documented
- Vite asset paths standardized for WSL compatibility

## Implementation Notes
- Using Cloudflare Workers environment detection (globalThis.ENVIRONMENT)
- Each environment has a unique database_id
- Local development has its own base configuration
- Data validation compares stored and initial data
- WSL requires specific network configuration:
  - Binding to 0.0.0.0 for host access
  - Port 8788 forwarding configuration
  - WSL 2 NAT considerations
- Asset path handling:
  - Unified paths for development and production
  - Removed manifest.json dependency
  - Simplified path resolution logic

## Open Questions
1. Should we add automated tests for the new validation logic?
2. Do we need to implement data migration support for future schema changes?
3. Should we add monitoring for initialization failures?
4. Should we create a WSL-specific configuration script to automate setup?
5. Do we need to document WSL firewall configuration steps in more detail?
6. Should we implement a development-only asset manifest for better debugging?

## Next Actions
1. Test database initialization in each environment
2. Consider implementing suggested monitoring improvements
3. Plan for potential data migration support
4. Evaluate need for WSL automation scripts
5. Test WSL configuration across different Windows environments
6. Verify asset loading in all admin routes
