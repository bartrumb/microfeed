# Active Context - 2025-03-02

## Current Focus: Vite and Cloudflare Integration
We are currently working on ensuring proper integration between Vite's build system and Cloudflare Workers environment. Recent work has focused on fixing asset loading issues, improving build configuration, and verifying prop name updates for the Webpack to Vite migration.

### Just Completed
- Fixed dynamic require error in Cloudflare Workers environment
- Implemented proper chunk configuration for constants and styles
- Enhanced CSS handling in HtmlHeader component
- Verified all Edge components have been updated to use the new `scripts` and `styles` props instead of the old `webpackJsList` and `webpackCssList` props

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Test production build in preview environment:
   - Deploy latest changes
   - Verify asset loading
   - Test CSS application
   - Validate bundling

2. Continue Cloudflare integration testing:
   - Verify Pages deployment
   - Test R2 bucket access
   - Validate asset caching

### Active Considerations
- Monitor asset loading performance
- Watch for any CSS loading issues
- Ensure consistent naming between chunk references in components and Vite configuration
- Verify environment detection accuracy
- Ensure proper error handling
- Track build output consistency
- Validate that all components are correctly using the `isDev` constant for environment-specific script loading

### Dependencies
- Vite build system
- Cloudflare Workers runtime
- React SSR implementation
- CSS bundling and splitting
- Asset preloading system

### Open Questions
- Do we need additional monitoring for asset loading?
- Should we implement automated tests for build output?
- Is the current chunk naming strategy optimal for caching and performance?
- Are there opportunities for further build optimization?
