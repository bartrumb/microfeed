## Current Focus: Resolving Asset Loading and Code Editor Issues

We are addressing several issues with asset loading and the code editor functionality:

### Fixed Issues

1. **Code Editor Template Loading**
   - ✅ Fixed missing theme template data in code editor
   - ✅ Updated route handler to pass correct template data
   - ✅ Ensured proper data structure for template rendering
   - ✅ Fixed slugify function loading in utils chunk

2. **Asset Loading**
   - ✅ Fixed CSS naming inconsistency
   - ✅ Added constants chunk configuration
   - ✅ Fixed path duplication in entry point file names
   - ✅ Enabled public directory serving for OpenAPI files

### Remaining Issues

1. **404 Errors**
   - [ ] ReactToastify.css.map not found
   - [ ] Missing manifest data for some chunks
   - [ ] Fallback paths being used for some assets

2. **Asset Loading Improvements**
   - [ ] Monitor asset loading performance
   - [ ] Implement retry logic for failed loads
   - [ ] Add error reporting for asset failures

### Action Items

1. **Fix ReactToastify Issues**
   - [ ] Add proper CSS map file
   - [ ] Update CSS extraction configuration

2. **Manifest Generation**
   - [ ] Fix manifest data generation
   - [ ] Ensure all chunks are properly registered
   - [ ] Update chunk naming strategy

### Dependencies
- Vite configuration
- React components
- Build pipeline
- Cloudflare Pages deployment

### Open Questions
- Should we implement retry logic for failed asset loads?
- Do we need additional monitoring for error states?
- Should we implement automated tests for these scenarios?
