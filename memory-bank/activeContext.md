# Active Context

## Current Task
Optimizing build configuration and resolving deployment issues

## Status
âœ… Completed:
- Removed redundant @tailwindcss/line-clamp plugin (now included in Tailwind CSS v3.3+)
- Fixed database initialization script
- Enhanced error handling in Cloudflare API calls
- Cleaned up wrangler.toml configuration

## Build Configuration
- Tailwind CSS: Using built-in line-clamp functionality
- Webpack: Clean plugin properly removing stale assets before builds
- Database: Improved error handling and logging for D1 operations

## Open Issues
1. Database initialization needs to be tested in each environment
2. Bundle size warnings need to be addressed (future optimization)

## Next Actions
1. Test database initialization:
   - Preview environment
   - Production deployment
2. Verify database tables are created correctly
3. Test full deployment workflow in each environment
