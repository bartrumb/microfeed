2. Created environment configuration files:
   - .dev.vars: Development environment
   - .preview.vars: Preview environment
   - .production.vars: Production environment

3. Environment-specific databases:
   - Development: shop-dawg-microfeed_feed_db_development
   - Preview: shop-dawg-microfeed_feed_db_preview
   - Production: shop-dawg-microfeed_feed_db_production

# Next Steps
1. Test preview deployment with updated R2 configuration
2. Test production deployment
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments
4. Add monitoring for deployment issues
