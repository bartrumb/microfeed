## Current Focus: TypeScript Migration Cleanup

We are currently in the process of migrating the Microfeed project from JavaScript/JSX to TypeScript. Several components have been successfully converted to TypeScript (.tsx), but the original JSX files still remain in the codebase. Our immediate focus is to clean up these redundant files.

### Identified Issues

1. **Redundant JSX Files**
   - Several components now have both .jsx and .tsx versions
   - This creates confusion about which file is actually being used
   - May lead to inconsistencies if changes are made to one file but not the other

2. **File Structure Documentation**
   - Need to maintain clear documentation of the migration progress
   - Track which components have been migrated and which still need conversion

### Action Items

1. **Remove Redundant JSX Files**
   - Identified 10 .jsx files that need to be removed (see progress.md for the list)
   - Need to verify application builds and runs correctly after removal

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Created fileStructureUpdate.md to track migration progress
   - Updated progress.md with current tasks

## Current Focus: Resolving Cloudflare Pages Deployment Issues

We are currently addressing persistent asset loading issues in the Cloudflare Pages preview deployment that are causing 404 errors and React warnings.

### Detailed Diagnosis

1. **CSS Asset Naming Inconsistency**
   - Vite outputs all CSS to `_app/immutable/assets/style.css` (vite.config.js line 137)
   - Application requests `admin-styles.css` and `index.css`
   - CSS extract config specifies `admin-styles.css` (line 197)
   - ManifestUtils.js expects either `admin-styles.css` or `index.css` (line 86)

2. **Missing constants.js File**
   - Referenced as critical chunk in ManifestUtils.js and withManifest.tsx
   - No entry for 'constants' in manualChunks configuration in vite.config.js
   - Results in 404 error for this resource

3. **React Property Case Warning**
   - Improper case for 'overRide' prop in AdminImageUploaderApp component
   - React requires lowercase 'override' to follow DOM attribute naming conventions

4. **Asset Validation Mismatch**
   - deploy.js validates `style.css` but app requests `admin-styles.css`
   - Allows deployment to succeed but fails at runtime

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Fix CSS Naming Consistency**
   - Align vite.config.js asset naming with ManifestUtils.js expectations
   - Use consistent CSS output filenames between build and runtime

2. **Add Constants Chunk Configuration**
   - Add 'constants' entry to manualChunks including Common-src/Constants.js
   - Ensure it outputs to the path expected by withManifest.tsx

3. **Fix React Prop Warning**
   - Locate use of `overRide` prop
   - Change to lowercase `override` to follow React naming conventions

4. **Update Asset Validation**
   - Align deploy.js asset validation with actual filenames used at runtime
   - Add checks for all required CSS files

### Dependencies
- Vite configuration
- React components
- Build pipeline
- Cloudflare Pages deployment

### Open Questions
- Should we implement retry logic for failed asset loads?
- Do we need additional monitoring for error states?
- Should we implement automated tests for these scenarios?
