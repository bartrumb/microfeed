# TypeScript Migration Decisions

## March 5, 2025 - Settings Components Migration

### Decision: Unified Settings Component Architecture
- Standardized props interfaces across all settings components
- Created shared types for common settings patterns
- Implemented consistent state management approach
- Rationale: Ensures type safety and maintainable code across settings

### Decision: Subscribe Methods Type System
- Created dedicated types for subscribe methods
- Added proper validation for method properties
- Implemented type-safe method management
- Rationale: Improves reliability of subscribe feature management

### Decision: Component Props Standardization
- Updated AdminSwitch to use optional label prop
- Standardized enabled/setEnabled pattern for toggles
- Added proper typing for custom styling props
- Rationale: Creates consistent component API across the application

## March 5, 2025 - Manifest System Migration

### Decision: Enhanced Type Safety for Asset Loading
- Converted ViteUtils.js and ManifestUtils.ts to use strict TypeScript types
- Added proper interfaces for manifest data structures
- Implemented type guards for manifest validation
- Rationale: Prevents runtime errors and improves code reliability

### Decision: Improved Manifest Validation
- Added isValidManifest type guard function
- Enhanced error handling for manifest loading
- Added strict typing for entry points using const assertions
- Rationale: Catches manifest-related issues earlier in the development process

### Decision: Unified Asset Type Handling
- Created shared types between ViteUtils and ManifestUtils
- Standardized asset type handling ('js' | 'css')
- Added proper type exports for cross-file usage
- Rationale: Ensures consistent asset handling across the codebase

## March 5, 2025 - MediaManager Component Migration

### Decision: Update MediaFile Interface
- Changed category property type from number to string to match ENCLOSURE_CATEGORIES constants
- Added optional sizeByte property to support file size tracking
- Rationale: Ensures type safety and better alignment with actual usage patterns

### Type System Improvements
- Implemented proper null checks for optional values
- Added type guards for safer data access
- Rationale: Prevents runtime errors and improves code reliability

### Component Architecture
- Maintained class component structure for MediaManager
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Rationale: Preserves existing component lifecycle while adding type safety
