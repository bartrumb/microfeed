## 2025-03-03: Detailed Analysis of Asset Loading Issues

### Context
After initial deployment fixes, we identified specific issues causing 404 errors and React warnings in the preview environment. A detailed analysis revealed problems with asset naming consistency, missing chunks, and validation gaps.

### Decisions Made

1. **Asset Naming Strategy**
   - Problem: Inconsistent CSS file naming between build output and runtime requests
   - Decision: Need to align vite.config.js CSS output with ManifestUtils.js expectations
   - Rationale: Prevents 404 errors and ensures consistent asset loading across environments

2. **Constants Chunk Management**
   - Problem: Missing constants.js chunk causing 404 errors
   - Decision: Add 'constants' to manualChunks configuration in vite.config.js
   - Rationale: Ensures critical chunk is properly built and available at runtime

3. **React Property Naming Convention**
   - Problem: Improper case for 'overRide' prop causing React warning
   - Decision: Change to lowercase 'override' to follow React conventions
   - Rationale: Follows React best practices and eliminates warning

4. **Asset Validation Enhancement**
   - Problem: Current validation allows deployment with missing required assets
   - Decision: Update deploy.js to validate all required CSS files
   - Rationale: Prevents incomplete deployments that would fail at runtime

### Technical Details

1. **CSS File Handling**
   - Current: All CSS output to style.css
   - Required: Separate admin-styles.css and index.css
   - Solution: Update CSS extract configuration and file naming

2. **Constants Chunk Configuration**
   - Add to manualChunks in vite.config.js
   - Include Common-src/Constants.js
   - Ensure proper path in output

3. **Asset Validation**
   - Add checks for admin-styles.css
   - Add checks for index.css
   - Validate constants.js presence
   - Add detailed error reporting

### Impact
- Resolves 404 errors for CSS and JS files
- Eliminates React warning
- Improves deployment reliability
- Better error detection during build

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Dynamic Asset Resolution**
   - Rejected: Would add complexity without solving root cause
   - Could introduce race conditions
   - Would make debugging more difficult

2. **Single CSS Bundle**
   - Rejected: Would require significant component changes
   - Doesn't align with current architecture
   - Could impact performance

3. **Runtime Asset Validation**
   - Rejected: Too late to catch issues
   - Could lead to production failures
   - Better to fail during deployment

### Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Build time increase from validation
   - Mitigation: Only validate critical assets
   - Mitigation: Optimize validation process

2. **Risk**: False positives in validation
   - Mitigation: Clear error messages
   - Mitigation: Document expected assets

3. **Risk**: Breaking changes from naming updates
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing
   - Mitigation: Clear deployment documentation

### Follow-up Tasks
1. Monitor asset loading performance
2. Consider implementing automated tests
3. Update deployment documentation
4. Create troubleshooting guide
