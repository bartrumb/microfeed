# Decision Log

## 2025-02-28: Database Initialization Improvements

**Decision**: Enhance database initialization process with better error handling and logging
- Added detailed error logging for API responses
- Improved environment-specific database configuration
- Removed duplicate preview configuration in wrangler.toml

**Rationale**:
- Silent failures were making it difficult to diagnose database creation issues
- Duplicate configuration in wrangler.toml was causing potential conflicts
- Better error messages will help future developers troubleshoot issues

**Impact**:
- More reliable database initialization process
- Clearer error messages when API calls fail
- Simplified wrangler.toml configuration

## 2024-02-28: Deployment Script Restructuring

**Decision**: Separate build and deployment steps for each environment
- Split into build:dev/deploy:dev
- Created build:preview/deploy:preview
- Added production safety check

**Rationale**:
- Separating build and deploy steps provides more control
- Safety check prevents accidental production deployments
- Consistent structure across environments reduces confusion

**Impact**:
- More predictable deployment process
- Reduced risk of accidental production deployments
- Better alignment with CI/CD best practices

## 2024-02-28: Webpack Configuration Update

**Decision**: Update webpack configuration for better asset handling
- Direct output to dist/
- Proper asset paths for production
- Unified build process for preview/production

**Rationale**:
- Consistent output location simplifies deployment
- Same build process reduces environment-specific issues
- Clean plugin ensures no stale assets remain

**Impact**:
- More reliable builds
- Simplified deployment process
- Reduced chance of serving stale assets

## Next Decisions Needed
1. Strategy for bundle size optimization
2. Approach for deployment documentation
3. Long-term database management strategy
