# TypeScript Migration Decisions

## March 5, 2025 - MediaManager Component Migration

### Decision: Update MediaFile Interface
- Changed category property type from number to string to match ENCLOSURE_CATEGORIES constants
- Added optional sizeByte property to support file size tracking
- Rationale: Ensures type safety and better alignment with actual usage patterns

### Type System Improvements
- Implemented proper null checks for optional values
- Added type guards for safer data access
- Rationale: Prevents runtime errors and improves code reliability

### Component Architecture
- Maintained class component structure for MediaManager
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Rationale: Preserves existing component lifecycle while adding type safety
