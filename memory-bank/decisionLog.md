# Decision Log

## 2025-02-28 16:28 CST - D1 Database Environment Configuration

**Decision**: Move preview environment D1 configuration to default configuration and use explicit environment flags.

**Context**: The preview environment D1 database was not being properly detected by wrangler commands, causing deployment failures.

**Solution**:
1. Added --env flag to wrangler D1 commands to explicitly specify the environment
2. Moved preview environment configuration to default configuration in wrangler.toml
3. Removed redundant preview environment section to avoid confusion

## 2025-02-28 16:13 CST - D1 Database Configuration Improvements

### Context
The wrangler.toml configuration for D1 databases was causing issues due to incorrect syntax and missing required fields.

### Decision
1. Use TOML array table syntax for D1 database configuration:
   - Chose `[[d1_databases]]` for base configuration
   - Used `[[env.{environment}.d1_databases]]` for environment-specific configs
   - Rationale: This follows Cloudflare's recommended structure for D1 bindings

2. Include required database_name field:
   - Added database_name field to both base and environment configs
   - Used cmd._non_dev_db() to maintain consistent naming
   - Rationale: database_name is required by Cloudflare D1 configuration

3. Remove JSON-style configuration:
   - Removed JSON object syntax from env configuration
   - Switched to pure TOML syntax
   - Rationale: Mixing JSON and TOML caused parsing errors

4. Improve configuration management:
   - Added environment-specific configuration handling
   - Preserved existing configurations when updating
   - Rationale: Prevents accidental deletion of other environment settings

### Consequences
- Positive:
  * Proper D1 database configuration across environments
  * More maintainable TOML structure
  * Better error handling for configuration updates
  * Preserved environment-specific settings
- Negative:
  * None identified

### Implementation Notes
- Used regex to safely update environment-specific sections
- Added error handling for missing configuration files
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing database IDs
