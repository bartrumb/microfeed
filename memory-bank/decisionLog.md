# Decision Log

## Accessibility and Performance Improvements (2025-03-01)

### Accessibility Utilities Implementation
**Decision**: Created a centralized AccessibilityUtils.js file with reusable functions
**Rationale**:
- Promotes consistent accessibility implementation across components
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes accessibility features easier to maintain and update
- Provides type-safe utilities for form fields, links, and images

### HTML Header Enhancements
**Decision**: Updated HtmlHeader component with comprehensive improvements
**Rationale**:
- Added lang attribute via JavaScript to ensure proper HTML language support

- Added proper ARIA attributes and labels
- Ensured all form fields have unique IDs and names
- Maintained existing functionality while improving accessibility

### Cache and Security Headers
**Decision**: Implemented cache control and security headers in middleware
**Rationale**:

- Removed unnecessary CSP header to reduce overhead
- Implemented proper cache control for static assets
- Used immutable directive for better caching performance

### Next Implementation Decisions Needed
1. Choose an automated accessibility testing framework
2. Decide on error boundary implementation strategy
3. Plan accessibility improvements for remaining components
4. Determine approach for image accessibility automation
