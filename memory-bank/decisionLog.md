# Implementation Decisions Log

## 2025-02-28 15:35 CST - R2 Configuration Error Handling

### Context
The R2 initialization was failing due to Windows/WSL line ending issues and missing variables in the TOML configuration.

### Decisions

1. TOML File Structure
   - Added environment-specific sections to TOML file for better organization
   - Required variables are now validated during TOML generation
   - Improved error messages for missing variables

2. Line Ending Handling
   - Added `tr -d '\r'` preprocessing to handle CRLF consistently
   - Using temporary file to ensure atomic operations
   - Added support for files without final newline

3. Error Validation
   - Added fail-fast behavior in generate_vars_toml.sh
   - Added required variable validation in init_r2.js
   - Improved error messages with specific variable names

### Rationale
- Early validation prevents partial configurations from being created
- Consistent line ending handling improves WSL compatibility
- Clear error messages help developers quickly identify configuration issues

### Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Temporary file creation in /tmp
  Mitigation: File is immediately removed after use
- Risk: Some variables might be environment-specific
  Mitigation: Variable requirements are checked per environment
