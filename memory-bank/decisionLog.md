# Decision Log

## [2025-02-28] Migration to pnpm/Vite/SvelteKit

### Decision
Migrate from Yarn/Webpack to pnpm/Vite with SvelteKit v5 and Cloudflare adapter

### Rationale
1. **Package Manager (pnpm)**
   - Better disk space efficiency
   - Strict dependency management
   - Faster installation times
   - Compatible with modern frontend tooling

2. **Bundler (Vite)**
   - Significantly faster development server startup
   - Better HMR performance
   - Native ESM support
   - Better integration with SvelteKit
   - Simpler configuration compared to Webpack

3. **Framework (SvelteKit v5)**
   - Better performance with Runes
   - Improved SSR capabilities
   - Built-in routing and layouts
   - Official Cloudflare adapter support
   - Modern development experience

4. **Not Using Bun**
   - Ecosystem support still emerging
   - Some compatibility issues with existing tools
   - SvelteKit's Cloudflare adapter better tested with Node.js

### Impact
- Requires migration of React components to Svelte
- Environment variable handling will be simplified
- Build and deployment processes will be streamlined
- Better development experience with faster builds
- Improved production performance

### Risks and Mitigations
1. **Component Migration**
   - Risk: Time-consuming conversion from React to Svelte
   - Mitigation: Gradual migration, starting with critical paths

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Risk: Different handling between Webpack and Vite
   - Mitigation: Centralize in .env.shared with clear sections

3. **Database Integration**
   - Risk: D1 database bindings may need adjustment
   - Mitigation: Careful testing in all environments

### Implementation Plan
1. Remove Yarn-specific files
2. Set up new pnpm configuration
3. Create Vite and SvelteKit configuration
4. Update deployment scripts
5. Begin component migration
6. Test in all environments

## [2025-02-28] Module System Update

### Decision
Convert CommonJS modules to ES modules, starting with Version.js

### Rationale
1. **Project Configuration**
   - Project is set to "type": "module" in package.json
   - Vite and SvelteKit expect ES modules by default
   - Cloudflare Workers runtime requires consistent module system

2. **Benefits**
   - Better compatibility with modern tooling
   - Cleaner import/export syntax
   - Improved tree-shaking
   - Consistent with project standards

### Impact
- Fixes module system incompatibility errors
- Enables proper bundling and execution in Cloudflare Workers
- Sets precedent for future module conversions

### Implementation
- Convert module.exports to named exports
- Update import statements in dependent files
- Maintain version information accessibility
- Test in development environment first
