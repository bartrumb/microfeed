# Decision Log

## Database Configuration and Initialization Improvements (2025-03-01)

### Context
- All environments were using the same database_id in wrangler.toml
- Local development lacked proper base configuration
- Database initialization needed better validation and logging

### Decisions Made

1. Database Configuration
   - Added base-level D1 configuration for local development
   - Assigned unique database_ids for each environment
   - Maintained consistent database naming scheme

2. Initialization Flow
   - Enhanced validation checks for initial data
   - Added detailed logging with environment awareness
   - Improved error handling with proper error propagation

3. Logging System
   - Implemented development-specific logging
   - Added structured metadata to all log messages
   - Standardized error logging format

### Rationale
- Separate database_ids prevent data conflicts between environments
- Enhanced validation ensures data integrity
- Improved logging helps with debugging and monitoring
- Development-specific logging reduces noise in production

### Technical Details
- Using Cloudflare Workers environment detection (globalThis.ENVIRONMENT)
- Implementing strict data validation with JSON comparison
- Structured logging with consistent metadata format

## Wrangler Pages Build Output Configuration (2025-03-01)

### Context
- Wrangler Pages dev server required explicit configuration for static assets
- Build output directory needed to be specified for proper local development

### Decisions Made
1. Build Output Configuration
   - Added pages_build_output_dir = "dist" to root configuration
   - Configured at root level to apply across all environments

### Rationale
- Explicit configuration prevents "Must specify a directory of static assets" error
- Consistent build output location across all environments
- Simplifies local development workflow by avoiding manual directory specification

## WSL Development Environment Configuration (2025-03-01)

### Context
- Local development under WSL requires specific configuration for Wrangler Pages
- Port forwarding and network access issues can prevent browser access
- Need standardized troubleshooting steps for WSL environment

### Decisions Made
1. WSL Network Configuration
   - Use `--ip 0.0.0.0` for Wrangler binding in WSL
   - Implement port forwarding checks for WSL 2
   - Document WSL-specific network debugging steps

2. Development Command Structure
   ```bash
   wrangler pages dev --compatibility-date=2024-02-28 --d1 FEED_DB --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8788
   ```

### Rationale
- Binding to 0.0.0.0 ensures accessibility from Windows host
- Explicit port configuration prevents conflicts
- Standardized command structure improves consistency

### Technical Details
- WSL 2 uses NAT for localhost access
- Port 8788 must be accessible from Windows host
- Firewall rules may need adjustment
- Miniflare integration requires specific WSL considerations

### Implementation Notes
1. Verification Steps:
   - Check Wrangler logs for binding confirmation
   - Test with curl inside WSL
   - Verify Windows browser access
   - Monitor port forwarding status

2. Troubleshooting Flow:
   - Start with WSL internal access verification
   - Progress to Windows host access checks
   - Check firewall and network configuration
   - Verify project structure and build output

## Vite Asset Path Configuration for WSL (2025-03-01)

### Context
- Asset loading failed in WSL environment
- Development paths in ViteUtils.js were incorrect
- Dynamic require of manifest.json not supported in WSL

### Decisions Made
1. Asset Path Standardization
   - Unified development and production paths
   - Removed dynamic manifest.json requirement
   - Simplified path resolution logic

2. Path Structure
   ```javascript
   const PATHS = {
     development: {
       js: '/assets/client',
       css: '/assets'
     },
     production: {
       js: '/assets/client',
       css: '/assets'
     }
   };
   ```

### Rationale
- Consistent paths between development and production
- Eliminates manifest.json dependency in development
- Simplifies asset resolution logic
- Better compatibility with WSL environment

### Technical Details
- Development and production now use same path structure
- Removed dynamic require calls
- Enhanced logging for asset path resolution
- Simplified error handling
