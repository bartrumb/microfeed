# Decision Log

## 2025-03-03: Fixed Development Database Configuration Issue

### Context
- Local development server was failing to find the D1 database configuration
- Error: "Couldn't find a D1 DB with the name or binding 'shop-dawg-microfeed_feed_db_development_development'"
- Project had configuration split between wrangler.json and wrangler.toml

### Decision
Updated wrangler.json to include development database configuration:
- Set correct database name: "shop-dawg-microfeed_feed_db_development_development"
- Added database ID from initialization: "c9f68fba-4b41-465f-bafe-e27608125941"
- Kept binding as "FEED_DB" for consistency

### Rationale
- Local development server specifically looks for configuration in wrangler.json
- Database was successfully created but binding configuration was missing
- Maintaining consistent binding name across environments

### Technical Details
- Database initialization scripts update wrangler.toml
- Deployment scripts update wrangler.json
- Both files need to be kept in sync for now
- Long-term recommendation: standardize on single configuration file

### Impact
- Enables local development server to connect to D1 database
- Maintains separation between development, preview, and production databases
- Preserves existing preview and production configurations
