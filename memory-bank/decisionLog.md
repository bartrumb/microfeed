# Decision Log

## TypeScript Migration Strategy (2025-03-05)

### Decision
Implemented a phased approach to TypeScript migration, starting with file extension changes.

### Context
- Project contained numerous JavaScript (.js) and React (.jsx) files
- Need to modernize codebase with TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- Large number of files requiring migration necessitated a structured approach

### Approach
1. Phase 1 (Complete):
   - Created and executed script to rename all .js/.jsx files to .ts/.tsx
   - Maintained existing code functionality while changing extensions
   - Updated documentation to reflect changes

2. Phase 2 (Planned):
   - Add TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Update build configuration
   - Fix type errors and ensure test coverage

### Rationale
- Breaking the migration into phases reduces risk and makes the process more manageable
- Starting with file extensions allows for gradual TypeScript adoption
- Automated script ensures consistency and reduces manual errors
- Documentation updates maintain project knowledge

### Impact
- All JavaScript files converted to TypeScript extensions
- Build system may require updates to handle TypeScript files
- Developers will need to add type definitions in subsequent phase

### Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Build system compatibility
  - Mitigation: Review and update build configuration as needed
- Risk: Import statement breaks
  - Mitigation: Update import statements in next phase
- Risk: Type errors in converted files
  - Mitigation: Address during type definition phase

### Status
- Phase 1 Complete: File extension migration
- Phase 2 Pending: Type definitions and configuration updates
