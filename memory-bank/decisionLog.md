# Decision Log

## Database Configuration and Initialization Improvements (2025-03-01)

### Context
- All environments were using the same database_id in wrangler.toml
- Local development lacked proper base configuration
- Database initialization needed better validation and logging

### Decisions Made

1. Database Configuration
   - Added base-level D1 configuration for local development
   - Assigned unique database_ids for each environment
   - Maintained consistent database naming scheme

2. Initialization Flow
   - Enhanced validation checks for initial data
   - Added detailed logging with environment awareness
   - Improved error handling with proper error propagation

3. Logging System
   - Implemented development-specific logging
   - Added structured metadata to all log messages
   - Standardized error logging format

### Rationale
- Separate database_ids prevent data conflicts between environments
- Enhanced validation ensures data integrity
- Improved logging helps with debugging and monitoring
- Development-specific logging reduces noise in production

### Technical Details
- Using Cloudflare Workers environment detection (globalThis.ENVIRONMENT)
- Implementing strict data validation with JSON comparison
- Structured logging with consistent metadata format

## Vite Build Configuration Improvements (2025-03-01)

### Context
- Build issues after webpack to Vite migration
- CommonJS/ESM compatibility issues with utils chunk
- Mixed import styles causing bundling problems

### Decisions Made
1. Import Style Standardization
   - Converted CommonJS require to ESM import for slugify
   - Maintained consistent import style with existing html-to-text import

2. Bundle Configuration
   - Simplified manualChunks configuration
   - Changed from dynamic function to static array format
   - Explicitly listed all dependencies in utils chunk

### Rationale
- Vite works best with ESM imports
- Static chunk configuration is more predictable
- Simpler configuration reduces potential build issues
- Consistent import style improves maintainability

### Technical Details
- Using ESM format for all imports
- Bundling utils dependencies together:
  * slugify
  * html-to-text
  * BrowserUtils
  * ClientUrlUtils
  * ToastUtils
  * StringUtils
  * TimeUtils
