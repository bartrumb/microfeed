## 2025-03-03: Asset Loading and Build Process Improvements

### Context
After initial fixes to the manifest system, we encountered issues with asset loading in the preview environment. The main problems were incorrect asset paths, missing CSS files, and inconsistent manifest handling. These issues needed to be addressed to ensure reliable deployments to Cloudflare Pages.

### Decisions Made

1. **Asset Path Resolution Strategy**
   - Unified asset path handling in vite.config.js
   - Removed CSS from manualChunks configuration
   - Used CSS extract configuration for consistent file naming
   - Rationale: Simplifies asset management and ensures consistent file names across environments

2. **Build Validation Enhancement**
   - Added required asset validation in deploy.js
   - Updated asset path checks to match actual build output
   - Added detailed error messages for missing assets
   - Rationale: Prevents deployment of incomplete builds and provides better debugging information

3. **Environment Detection Improvement**
   - Added isCloudflarePages helper
   - Enhanced preview mode detection logic
   - Consolidated environment checks
   - Rationale: More reliable environment-specific behavior and better code organization

### Technical Details

1. **Asset Path Changes**
   - Removed CSS from manualChunks
   - Set fixed CSS output filename
   - Added proper path resolution for chunks
   - Improved error handling for missing assets

2. **Build Process Updates**
   - Added asset validation step
   - Fixed CSS file handling
   - Improved manifest generation
   - Enhanced error reporting

3. **Environment Detection**
   - Added new environment helpers
   - Improved preview mode detection
   - Enhanced manifest loading logic

### Impact
- Resolves asset loading issues in preview environment
- Improves build reliability
- Enhances error detection and reporting
- Simplifies asset management
- Better supports Cloudflare Pages deployments

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep CSS in manualChunks**
   - Rejected due to inconsistent file naming
   - Would require more complex path resolution

2. **Skip Asset Validation**
   - Rejected due to potential for incomplete deployments
   - Would make debugging more difficult

3. **Use Dynamic Asset Resolution**
   - Rejected due to potential race conditions
   - Would increase complexity without clear benefits

### Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Build time increases due to validation
   - Mitigation: Only validate critical assets

2. **Risk**: False positives in asset validation
   - Mitigation: Added detailed error messages and clear asset lists

3. **Risk**: Environment detection issues
   - Mitigation: Added multiple fallback checks

### Follow-up Tasks
1. Monitor asset loading performance
2. Consider implementing automated tests for build output
3. Document new build process and validation steps
4. Create troubleshooting guide for deployment issues
