# Decision Log

## 2025-02-28 15:48 CST - D1 Database Configuration Enhancement
**Decision**: Modify init_feed_db.js to handle database IDs automatically
**Context**: Preview environment setup was failing due to missing database_id field in wrangler.toml
**Rationale**:
- Wrangler now requires database_id field for D1 database bindings
- Manual ID management is error-prone and time-consuming
- Project already had getDatabaseId utility that wasn't being utilized

**Implementation Details**:
1. Enhanced init_feed_db.js to:
   - Create database first
   - Fetch database ID using existing utility
   - Update wrangler.toml automatically
   - Handle environment-specific configurations
   - Maintain proper TOML structure

**Risks Considered**:
- Database creation race conditions
- API token permissions
- TOML file corruption during updates

**Mitigation**:
- Added proper error handling
- Validate database ID before updating TOML
- Maintain TOML structure during updates
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

**Impact**:
- Streamlined database setup process
- Reduced manual configuration steps
- Improved reliability of preview/production deployments
- Better error feedback for failed operations
