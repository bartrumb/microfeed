   - Adding type guards for safer data access

### Next Steps

1. **Continue Component Migration**
   - [ ] Convert AdminWholeHtml component
   - [ ] Convert remaining Edge components
   - [ ] Add type annotations to server-side handlers
   - [ ] Update component tests with TypeScript

2. **Utility Functions Migration**
   - [ ] Convert utility files to TypeScript
   - [ ] Add type guards for safer data access
   - [ ] Implement typed versions of common functions
   - [ ] Add tests for type guards

3. **Testing and Verification**
   - [ ] Test type definitions with existing components
   - [ ] Verify type checking catches potential errors
   - [ ] Monitor error logs to ensure fixes are working
   - [ ] Add automated tests for type guards

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update technical documentation with type system details
   - [ ] Document type guard usage patterns
   - [ ] Create migration guide for remaining components
   - [ ] Add examples of common typing patterns

### Microfeed Preview Deployment Fix

1. **Fix Asset Loading Issues**
   - ✅ Fix CSS naming inconsistency between build output and runtime requests
   - ✅ Add constants.js to manual chunks in vite.config.js
   - ✅ Fixed theme template data loading in code editor
   - ✅ Fix 404 errors for source map files:
     - ✅ ReactToastify.css.map - Disabled CSS source maps in production
     - ✅ Constants.js.map - Fixed case sensitivity in chunk naming
   - ✅ Fixed Constants module duplication causing admin entry issues

2. **Implement Source Map Fixes**
   - ✅ Update vite.config.js to disable source maps in production
   - ✅ Fix case sensitivity mismatch in chunk naming (constants → Constants)
   - ✅ Update CSS extraction configuration with devSourcemap option
   - ✅ Added source map verification in deployment process

3. **Fix Constants Module Duplication**
   - ✅ Identified Constants module defined in two different chunks
   - ✅ Removed Constants from 'core-utils' chunk
   - ✅ Kept only the standalone 'Constants' chunk with proper casing
   - ✅ Successfully deployed with fixed Constants module

4. **Fix Case Preservation in Output Files**
   - ✅ Identified issue with Vite normalizing chunk names to lowercase
   - ✅ Modified chunkFileNames configuration to explicitly preserve case for Constants chunk
   - ✅ Ensured output filename matches what the application is trying to load
   - ✅ Successfully deployed with case-preserved Constants.js file
   - ✅ Fixed case mismatch in deploy.js verification step (constants.js → Constants.js)

3. **Validate and Test Fixes**
   - ✅ Deploy to preview environment and verify all assets load correctly
   - ✅ Verified source map handling in build process
   - ✅ Confirmed successful deployment to preview environment
   - ✅ Documented the fixes and updated the deployment process
   - ✅ Deploy to production environment to fix 404 errors for Constants.js
