# Project Progress

## Recent Updates

### 2025-03-05
- Completed initial phase of TypeScript migration
  - Renamed all .js/.jsx files to .ts/.tsx
  - Created migration documentation in typeCheckingPlan.md
  - Setup foundation for adding type definitions

- Implemented TypeScript types for core functionality
  - Created comprehensive type definitions in common-src/types/
    - FeedContent.ts: Core application types
    - CloudflareTypes.ts: Cloudflare Workers and Pages types
  
  - Fixed type errors in key API files:
    - functions/api/_middleware.ts
    - functions/api/feed/index.ts
    - functions/api/items/index.tsx
    - functions/api/media_files/presigned_urls/index.tsx

  - Implemented types for model classes:
    - DatabaseInitializer.ts: Database setup and initialization
    - FeedDb.ts: Database operations
    - FeedPublicJsonBuilder.ts: JSON feed generation
    - FeedPublicRssBuilder.ts: RSS feed generation
    - Theme.ts: Theme management

## Current Status
- TypeScript Migration: Phase 2 In Progress
  - Core type definitions established
  - API endpoints typed
  - Model classes fully typed
  - Remaining React components need type implementation

## Next Steps
1. Continue Adding TypeScript Types
   - Type remaining React components in client-src/
   - Type remaining React components in edge-src/
   - Add proper error handling types
   - Add JSDoc documentation

2. Update Build Configuration
   - Review and update tsconfig.json
   - Modify build scripts if needed
   - Update import statements

3. Testing
   - Run TypeScript compiler
   - Fix any remaining type errors
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Add type tests where appropriate

## Blockers
- Need to properly type Cloudflare Workers APIs
- Some third-party dependencies may need type definitions
- React component props need thorough typing

## Notes
- Migration script executed successfully
- Core type definitions in place
- API endpoints and models fully typed
- React components are next priority
- Need to maintain strict type checking
