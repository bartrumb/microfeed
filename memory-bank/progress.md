   - [ ] Add type annotations to server-side handlers
   - [ ] Update component tests with TypeScript

2. **Utility Functions Migration**
   - [ ] Convert utility files to TypeScript
   - [ ] Add type guards for safer data access
   - [ ] Implement typed versions of common functions
   - [ ] Add tests for type guards

3. **Testing and Verification**
   - [ ] Test type definitions with existing components
   - [ ] Verify type checking catches potential errors
   - [ ] Monitor error logs to ensure fixes are working
   - [ ] Add automated tests for type guards

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update technical documentation with type system details
   - [ ] Document type guard usage patterns
   - [ ] Create migration guide for remaining components
   - [ ] Add examples of common typing patterns

## Microfeed Preview Deployment Fix

### Completed Tasks

1. **Initial Investigation**
   - ✅ Identified 404 errors for JavaScript files in preview environment
   - ✅ Analyzed build output vs. HTML references
   - ✅ Identified issues with manifest handling and environment detection

2. **Manifest Handling Improvements**
   - ✅ Updated environment detection in ManifestUtils.js
   - ✅ Enhanced withManifest HOC to properly load manifest data
   - ✅ Updated manifest-virtual.js for better data handling
   - ✅ Fixed manifest path resolution for production vs. preview environments

3. **Edge Component Updates**
   - ✅ Fixed script loading in all Edge components
   - ✅ Removed duplicate script references
   - ✅ Fixed critical chunk handling to prevent 404 errors

4. **Build Process Enhancements**
   - ✅ Updated deploy.js script to handle manifest data properly
   - ✅ Improved asset path generation in Vite configuration
   - ✅ Disabled minification in preview environment
   - ✅ Added proper terserOptions to preserve function names
   - ✅ Fixed asset copying to properly handle built assets
   - ✅ Added build validation for required assets
   - ✅ Fixed CSS file handling and naming

5. **Deployment Verification**
   - ✅ Successfully deployed to preview environment
   - ✅ Fixed deploy script to work with Cloudflare Pages
   - ✅ Verified all assets loading correctly
   - ✅ Confirmed Cloudflare Access protection working

6. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - ✅ Added ErrorBoundary component for graceful error handling
   - ✅ Implemented proper null checks in AllItemsApp component
   - ✅ Added fallback UI for error states
   - ✅ Ensured proper data structure initialization

### Current Status
- ✅ All asset loading issues fixed
- ✅ Deployment working correctly with Cloudflare Access
- ✅ Build process properly handling all required files

### Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Monitor asset loading performance
   - [ ] Consider implementing automated tests for build output
   - [ ] Evaluate chunk naming strategy for optimal caching
   - [ ] Consider implementing build output validation

2. **Testing and Verification**
   - ✅ Test preview deployment with updated asset handling
   - ✅ Verify manifest loading in preview environment
   - ✅ Monitor for any new 404 errors or module loading issues
   - [ ] Create automated tests for build output validation

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update technical documentation with build process changes
   - [ ] Document environment-specific configuration options
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for deployment issues
   - [ ] Document manifest system architecture
