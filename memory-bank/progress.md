# Project Progress

## Microfeed Preview Deployment Fix

### Current Tasks

1. **Fix Asset Loading Issues**
   - ✅ Fix CSS naming inconsistency between build output and runtime requests
   - ✅ Add constants.js to manual chunks in vite.config.js
   - ✅ Fixed theme template data loading in code editor
   - ✅ Fix 404 errors for source map files:
     - ✅ ReactToastify.css.map - Disabled CSS source maps in production
     - ✅ Constants.js.map - Fixed case sensitivity in chunk naming
   - ✅ Fixed Constants module duplication causing admin entry issues

2. **Implement Source Map Fixes**
   - ✅ Update vite.config.js to disable source maps in production
   - ✅ Fix case sensitivity mismatch in chunk naming (constants → Constants)
   - ✅ Update CSS extraction configuration with devSourcemap option
   - ✅ Added source map verification in deployment process

3. **Fix Constants Module Duplication**
   - ✅ Identified Constants module defined in two different chunks
   - ✅ Removed Constants from 'core-utils' chunk
   - ✅ Kept only the standalone 'Constants' chunk with proper casing
   - ✅ Successfully deployed with fixed Constants module

4. **Fix Case Preservation in Output Files**
   - ✅ Identified issue with Vite normalizing chunk names to lowercase
   - ✅ Modified chunkFileNames configuration to explicitly preserve case for Constants chunk
   - ✅ Ensured output filename matches what the application is trying to load
   - ✅ Successfully deployed with case-preserved Constants.js file
   - ✅ Fixed case mismatch in deploy.js verification step (constants.js → Constants.js)

3. **Validate and Test Fixes**
   - ✅ Deploy to preview environment and verify all assets load correctly
   - ✅ Verified source map handling in build process
   - ✅ Confirmed successful deployment to preview environment
   - ✅ Documented the fixes and updated the deployment process
   - ✅ Deploy to production environment to fix 404 errors for Constants.js

### Implementation Plan (Completed)

1. **Source Map Configuration**
   - ✅ Modify vite.config.js to conditionally enable source maps:
     ```javascript
     sourcemap: mode === 'development' ? true : false,
     ```

2. **Fix Case Sensitivity Issue**
   - ✅ Update chunk naming in vite.config.js:
     ```javascript
     'constants': ['@common/Constants'] → 'Constants': ['@common/Constants']
     ```

3. **CSS Source Map Handling**
   - ✅ Update CSS extraction configuration to handle source maps:
     ```javascript
     devSourcemap: mode === 'development' ? true : false,
     ```

4. **Deployment Process Improvement**
   - ✅ Add verification for source map files in deploy.js
   - ✅ Successfully deployed to preview environment:
     ```
     ✨ Deployment complete! Take a peek over at https://dd4627d5.shop-dawg-microfeed.pages.dev
     ✨ Deployment alias URL: https://preview.shop-dawg-microfeed.pages.dev
     ```
   - ✅ Successfully deployed to production environment:
     ```
     ✨ Deployment complete! Take a peek over at https://a7724e97.shop-dawg-microfeed.pages.dev
     ✨ Deployment alias URL: https://production.shop-dawg-microfeed.pages.dev
     ```
   - ✅ Fixed case mismatch in deploy.js verification step:
     ```javascript
     // Changed from:
     'dist/_app/immutable/chunks/constants.js' // lowercase 'c'
     // To:
     'dist/_app/immutable/chunks/Constants.js' // uppercase 'C'
     ```

### Next Steps
