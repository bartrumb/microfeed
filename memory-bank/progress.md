# Project Progress

## Microfeed Preview Deployment Fix

### Completed Tasks

1. **Initial Investigation**
   - ✅ Identified 404 errors for JavaScript files in preview environment
   - ✅ Analyzed build output vs. HTML references
   - ✅ Identified issues with manifest handling and environment detection

2. **Manifest Handling Improvements**
   - ✅ Updated environment detection in ManifestUtils.js
   - ✅ Enhanced withManifest HOC to properly load manifest data
   - ✅ Updated manifest-virtual.js for better data handling
   - ✅ Fixed manifest path resolution for production vs. preview environments

3. **Edge Component Updates**
   - ✅ Fixed script loading in all Edge components
   - ✅ Removed duplicate script references
   - ✅ Fixed critical chunk handling to prevent 404 errors

4. **Build Process Enhancements**
   - ✅ Updated deploy.js script to handle manifest data properly
   - ✅ Improved asset path generation in Vite configuration
   - ✅ Disabled minification in preview environment to prevent export name mangling
   - ✅ Added proper terserOptions to preserve function names in preview builds

5. **Deployment Verification**
   - ✅ Successfully deployed to preview environment
   - ✅ Fixed deploy script to work with Cloudflare Pages

### Current Issues

We're still seeing module loading errors in the preview environment:
- Error: `SyntaxError: The requested module './utils.js' does not provide an export named 'c'`
- Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'webGlobalSettings')`

The first error indicates that despite our changes to prevent minification, JavaScript is still being mangled in the preview environment. The second error suggests that feed settings data isn't being properly loaded.

### Next Steps

1. **Further Optimization of Preview Build**
   - Implement a more comprehensive approach to preventing export name mangling
   - Consider using `preserveModules: true` in the Vite configuration for preview environment
   - Test with different Vite plugins for ES module preservation

2. **Feed Settings Data Loading**
   - Investigate why feed settings data isn't properly loaded
   - Add error handling to prevent undefined property access
   - Ensure initialization order is correct

3. **Testing and Verification**
   - Deploy to preview environment with new changes
   - Verify all JavaScript modules load correctly
   - Create automated tests for build output validation

4. **Documentation**
   - Update technical documentation with build process changes
   - Document environment-specific configuration options
   - Add troubleshooting guide for deployment issues
