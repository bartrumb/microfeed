# Project Progress

## Type Checking Implementation

### Completed Tasks

1. **Core Type Definitions**
   - ✅ Created common-src/types/FeedContent.ts with core interfaces
   - ✅ Implemented type guards for safer data access
   - ✅ Added utility types for common patterns
   - ✅ Added JSDoc documentation for better IDE support

2. **Critical Component Migration**
   - ✅ Converted ErrorBoundary component to TypeScript
   - ✅ Added proper error and props typing
   - ✅ Converted withManifest HOC to TypeScript
   - ✅ Added generic type support to withManifest
   - ✅ Converted EdgeAdminItemsApp to TypeScript
   - ✅ Enhanced client-side script safety with null checks

3. **Type System Setup**
   - ✅ Verified TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
   - ✅ Confirmed proper path aliases for @common imports
   - ✅ Set up proper JSX handling
   - ✅ Added type definitions for manifest data

### Current Tasks

1. **Component Migration**
   - Converting AdminWholeHtml component to TypeScript
   - Adding type annotations to server-side handlers
   - Converting remaining Edge components

2. **Utility Function Migration**
   - Converting StringUtils.js to TypeScript
   - Converting TimeUtils.js to TypeScript
   - Converting ManifestUtils.js to TypeScript
   - Adding type guards for safer data access

### Next Steps

1. **Continue Component Migration**
   - [ ] Convert AdminWholeHtml component
   - [ ] Convert remaining Edge components
   - [ ] Add type annotations to server-side handlers
   - [ ] Update component tests with TypeScript

2. **Utility Functions Migration**
   - [ ] Convert utility files to TypeScript
   - [ ] Add type guards for safer data access
   - [ ] Implement typed versions of common functions
   - [ ] Add tests for type guards

3. **Testing and Verification**
   - [ ] Test type definitions with existing components
   - [ ] Verify type checking catches potential errors
   - [ ] Monitor error logs to ensure fixes are working
   - [ ] Add automated tests for type guards

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update technical documentation with type system details
   - [ ] Document type guard usage patterns
   - [ ] Create migration guide for remaining components
   - [ ] Add examples of common typing patterns

## Microfeed Preview Deployment Fix

### Completed Tasks

1. **Initial Investigation**
   - ✅ Identified 404 errors for JavaScript files in preview environment
   - ✅ Analyzed build output vs. HTML references
   - ✅ Identified issues with manifest handling and environment detection

2. **Manifest Handling Improvements**
   - ✅ Updated environment detection in ManifestUtils.js
   - ✅ Enhanced withManifest HOC to properly load manifest data
   - ✅ Updated manifest-virtual.js for better data handling
   - ✅ Fixed manifest path resolution for production vs. preview environments

3. **Edge Component Updates**
   - ✅ Fixed script loading in all Edge components
   - ✅ Removed duplicate script references
   - ✅ Fixed critical chunk handling to prevent 404 errors

4. **Build Process Enhancements**
   - ✅ Updated deploy.js script to handle manifest data properly
   - ✅ Improved asset path generation in Vite configuration
   - ✅ Disabled minification in preview environment
   - ✅ Added proper terserOptions to preserve function names

5. **Deployment Verification**
   - ✅ Successfully deployed to preview environment
   - ✅ Fixed deploy script to work with Cloudflare Pages

6. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - ✅ Added ErrorBoundary component for graceful error handling
   - ✅ Implemented proper null checks in AllItemsApp component
   - ✅ Added fallback UI for error states
   - ✅ Ensured proper data structure initialization

### Current Issues

We're still seeing module loading errors in the preview environment:
- Error: `SyntaxError: The requested module './utils.js' does not provide an export named 'c'`
- Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'webGlobalSettings')`

The first error indicates that despite our changes to prevent minification, JavaScript is still being mangled in the preview environment. The second error suggests that feed settings data isn't being properly loaded.

### Next Steps

1. **Further Optimization of Preview Build**
   - [ ] Implement a more comprehensive approach to preventing export name mangling
   - [ ] Consider using `preserveModules: true` in the Vite configuration
   - [ ] Test with different Vite plugins for ES module preservation

2. **Feed Settings Data Loading**
   - [ ] Investigate why feed settings data isn't properly loaded
   - [ ] Add error handling to prevent undefined property access
   - [ ] Ensure initialization order is correct

3. **Testing and Verification**
   - [ ] Deploy to preview environment with new changes
   - [ ] Verify all JavaScript modules load correctly
   - [ ] Create automated tests for build output validation

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update technical documentation with build process changes
   - [ ] Document environment-specific configuration options
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for deployment issues
