- Separated preview into build:preview and deploy:preview
- Added production safety check to deploy:prod
- Streamlined environment variable handling

## 2024-02-28: Deployment Configuration Updates

✅ Streamlined deployment process:
- Updated webpack to output directly to dist/
- Configured proper asset paths for production
- Created unified deployment process for both preview and production

## Next Steps
1. Test database initialization in each environment:
   - Preview environment
   - Production environment
2. Verify database tables are created correctly
3. Consider bundle size optimization (future task)
4. Add deployment documentation to help future developers
